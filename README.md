A App for Doctor to manage Patient's Information and Logistics Supplies

### TechStack:
Swift,
SwiftUI,
MLKit,
MySql,
AWS,
Xcode

## Purpose

### Inspiration

the new age of analytics and software that could help the medical field save time on mundane tasks like managing paperwork and inventory and shift their focus on helping people even more! Furthermore, we were inspired by the people at McKesson when it came to communication between them and their clients. Most of us have had visits to the doctors where we forgot about some medicines that they told us to take or simply were not able to understand the doctor's handwriting...


Our application would guide the patient in that regard, while also helping the doctor and their staff take care of small tasks that take so much of their valuable time that could be spent taking care of other patients and helping the world even more.

### Function

This mobile application expedites the patient-physician relationship allowing more time for the doctor to meet with patients by reducing admin tasks. Allow for the doctor to request a resupply of stock in a simple intuitive function. Utilize NLP on physician notes and session recordings to gain data that allows for features that can revolutionize healthcare.

### Challenges

None of us were familiar with React-Native, so we thought that learning new technology in this project would make sense, around 20 hours into the project we were able to set up our frontend in React-Native, meaning that we accomplished our goal of learning how to utilize React-Native, however, we were not able to implement and train the NLP/ML model for our backend in time, it would have taken us quite a lot of time. Therefore, we decided to use a premade ML library by Apple that allowed us to implement NLP into our front end, made with SwiftUI, seamlessly after we changed a few parameters and dependencies.

## App Design

### UI/UX

We know that our target audience includes a large variety of people throughout the United States, and maybe even the world, that is why we knew that we needed to create a simple UI with only at most 4 pressable buttons on the screen at one time.


### Swift

Using Swift and SwiftUI we were able to create a frontend that was tightly integrated with our backend and ML scripts.
